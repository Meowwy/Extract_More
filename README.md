This simple app for Windows is designed to extract compressed files from all the subdirectories of the "root" directory selected by you.

Get one for yourself, temporarily by sending mail to koleckar551@gmail.com
The number of supported file formats will grow :)

## Functionality
The program searches throw all the things contained in root folder. If it founds a file of supported file format, it un-packs its content and leaves it in the same position in a tree structure. Finally, source file is deleted.
